  abstract = {Proofs from SMT solvers ensure correctness independently from implementation, which is often a requirement when solvers are used in safety-critical applications or proof assistants. Alethe is an established SMT proof format generated by the solvers veriT and cvc5, with reconstruction support in the proof assistants Isabelle/HOL and Coq. The format is close to SMT-LIB and allows both coarse- and fine-grained steps, facilitating proof production. However, it lacks a stand-alone checker, which harms its usability and hinders its adoption. Moreover, the coarsegrained steps can be too expensive to check and lead to verification failures. We present Carcara, an independent proof checker and elaborator for Alethe, implemented in Rust. It aims to increase the adoption of the format by providing push-button proof-checking for Alethe proofs, focusing on efficiency and usability; and by providing elaboration for coarsegrained steps into fine-grained ones, increasing the potential success rate of checking Alethe proofs in performance-critical validators, such as proof assistants. We evaluate Carcara over a large set of Alethe proofs generated from SMT-LIB problems and show that it has good performance and its elaboration techniques can make proofs easier to check.},

  abstract = {SMT solvers have throughout the years been able to cope with increasingly expressive formulas, from ground logics to full first-order logic (FOL). In contrast, the extension of SMT solvers to higher-order logic (HOL) is mostly unexplored. We propose a pragmatic extension for SMT solvers to support HOL reasoning natively without compromising performance on FOL reasoning, thus leveraging the extensive research and implementation efforts dedicated to efficient SMT solving. We show how to generalize data structures and the ground decision procedure to support partial applications and extensionality, as well as how to reconcile quantifier instantiation techniques with higher-order variables. We also discuss a separate approach for redesigning an HOL SMT solver from the ground up via new data structures and algorithms. We apply our pragmatic extension to the CVC4 SMT solver and discuss a redesign of the veriT SMT solver. Our evaluation shows they are competitive with state-of-the-art HOL provers and often outperform the traditional encoding into FOL.},

abstract="Insightful error reports save precious time in the design of systems. When using the formal B method, design errors correspond to invalid proof obligations. The legacy automatic provers in Atelier B are not capable to identify if a failure to prove is due to a logical error. In contrast, SMT solvers are capable to prove a first-order logic formula but also to disprove it and to produce a counter-example. Those counter-examples can give precious indications to the user on design errors. SMT solvers have been integrated in the most recent version of Atelier B, but only to use their proving capabilities. We present here counter{\_}example{\_}reader, a tool to interpret a counter-example produced by an SMT solver into a B counter-example.",
