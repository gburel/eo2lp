  abstract = {Proofs from SMT solvers ensure correctness independently from implementation, which is often a requirement when solvers are used in safety-critical applications or proof assistants. Alethe is an established SMT proof format generated by the solvers veriT and cvc5, with reconstruction support in the proof assistants Isabelle/HOL and Coq. The format is close to SMT-LIB and allows both coarse- and fine-grained steps, facilitating proof production. However, it lacks a stand-alone checker, which harms its usability and hinders its adoption. Moreover, the coarsegrained steps can be too expensive to check and lead to verification failures. We present Carcara, an independent proof checker and elaborator for Alethe, implemented in Rust. It aims to increase the adoption of the format by providing push-button proof-checking for Alethe proofs, focusing on efficiency and usability; and by providing elaboration for coarsegrained steps into fine-grained ones, increasing the potential success rate of checking Alethe proofs in performance-critical validators, such as proof assistants. We evaluate Carcara over a large set of Alethe proofs generated from SMT-LIB problems and show that it has good performance and its elaboration techniques can make proofs easier to check.},

We describe work in progress for interpreting Alethe proofs and generating corresponding proofs that are accepted by the Lambdapi proof checker, a foundational proof assistant based on dependent type theory and rewriting rules that serve as a pivot for exchanging proofs between several interactive proof assistants. We give an overview of the encoding of SMT logic and Alethe proofs in Lambdapi and present initial results of the evaluation of the checker on benchmark examples.},
