The phrase \emph{satisfiability modulo theories} (SMT)
refers to an area of automated reasoning that aims
to develop tools for deciding the satisfiability of
logical specifications within a curated selection of
mathematical theories~\cite{Barrett2021}.
%
% SMT solvers exist: cvc5, veriT, z3.
% SMT-LIB standard exists:
%   2.6 (many-sorted FOL)
%   2.7 (they added lambdas??)
%   3.0 proposal -
%     near to Eunoia but very different.
%     SMT3 actually allows higher-order SMT problems,
%     Eunoia just uses higher-order stuff for rules, programs, type definitions, etc.
%

% proof production
For specifications deemed unsatisfiabile, many SMT solvers
are capable of generating \emph{proof certificates}
that demonstrate this fact.
%
Proof generation is not covered by the SMT-LIB standard,
and so many proof formats have been developed with the
aim of abstracting over the differences in
proof generation facilities between solvers.
%
% in particular: LFSC, Alethe.
% however, the rules of Alethe are fixed, and are informal by our standards.
This can make the development of proof checkers challenging,
as developers must rewrite parts of their checker for every
change made to the proof system.

\textit{Eunoia} is a logical framework that allows formalizing
the inference rules used by the proof production facilities
of an SMT solver.
%
\textit{Ethos} is a C++ tool for verifying proofs in the
Eunoia format.

% eunoia is (similar to)/(inspired by) by the speculative
% proposal for SMT-LIB 3.
SMT-LIB is a specification language used for interacting
with SMT solvers. The syntax and semantics of SMT-LIB are
standardized by the
SMT-LIB Initiative~\autocite{Barrett2015-standard}).
%
Generally speaking, SMT-LIB scripts specify satisfiability
problems for many-sorted first-order logic (MFOL) and
provide instructions for solvers to interact with these
specifications.
