%
The area of automated reasoning research known as
\emph{satisfiability modulo theories} (SMT)
aims to develop tools capable of deciding
the satisfiability of logical specifications
within a curated selection of mathematical theories~\cite{Barrett2021}.
%
% Whilst many  accomplish this task
% with similar strategies, the approach employed by
% a solver can vary, meaning that different solvers
% will excel in different theories.
%
Towards the aim of standardizing and benchmarking
such tools (known as SMT \emph{solvers}),
the \emph{SMT library initivate} oversee the development of
the \emph{SMT-LIB standard}.
%
The standard specifies a common language used
for interacting with solvers, including a detailed
description of the mathematical foundations of the SMT problem.

% Theories are typically first-order.
% Since SMT is an extension of the SAT problem,
% SMT goes beyond the traditional SAT problem, logical
% specifications are first-order logic.

% SMT solvers exist: cvc5, veriT, z3.
% SMT-LIB standard exists:
%   2.6 (many-sorted FOL)
%   2.7 (they added lambdas??)
%   3.0 proposal -
%     near to Eunoia but very different.
%     SMT3 actually allows higher-order SMT problems,
%     Eunoia just uses higher-order stuff for rules, programs, type definitions, etc.
%

% some mention of SMT solvers used by Isabelle, Coq, Lean, etc.

% proof production
For specifications deemed unsatisfiable, many solvers
can generate \emph{proof certificates} that demonstrate
the absurdity of the assertions made by the specification.
%
Proof generation is however not covered by the SMT-LIB
standard, which has led to the development of various proof
formats for SMT solvers.
%%
In particular, the \emph{Alethe} format draws from
a fixed set of rules designed to reflect the
reasoning mechanisms of SMT solvers.
%
The common proof interface provided by Alethe has
enabled interoperability between solvers and other
automated reasoning tools;
particularly \emph{proof assistants}.
%
Unfortunately, long-term interoperability can be
challenging, as developers must rewrite aspects
of their tools to maintain parity with the evolving
Alethe specification.
%
\textit{Eunoia} is a logical framework that allows formalizing
the inference rules used by the proof production facilities
of an SMT solver.
%
\textit{Ethos} is a C++ tool for verifying proofs in the
Eunoia format.

% % eunoia is (similar to)/(inspired by) by the speculative
% % proposal for SMT-LIB 3.
% SMT-LIB is a specification language used for interacting
% with SMT solvers. The syntax and semantics of SMT-LIB are
% standardized by the
% SMT-LIB Initiative~\autocite{Barrett2015-standard}).
% %
% Generally speaking, SMT-LIB scripts specify satisfiability
% problems for many-sorted first-order logic (MFOL) and
% provide instructions for solvers to interact with these
% specifications.
