The area of automated reasoning known as
\emph{satisfiability modulo theories} (SMT) is aimed
primarily at developing tools for deciding the
(un)satisfiability of logical specifications from various
mathematical theories~\cite{Barrett2021}.
%
When a specification is deemed to be unsatisfiable,
many solvers are capable of demonstrating this fact through
the generation proof certificates.
%
Many proof formats exist (e.g., Alethe, LFSC), but the
inference rules used in their proofs are not specified in
any formal language.
%
This can make the development of proof checkers challenging,
as developers must rewrite parts of their checker for every
change made to the proof system.

\textit{Eunoia} is a logical framework that allows formalizing
the inference rules used by the proof production facilities
of an SMT solver.
%
\textit{Ethos} is a C++ tool for verifying proofs in the
Eunoia format.

% eunoia is similar/inspired by the speculative proposal for SMT-LIB 3.
SMT-LIB is a specification language used for interacting
with SMT solvers. The syntax and semantics of SMT-LIB are
standardized by the
SMT-LIB Initiative~\autocite{Barrett2015-standard}).
%
Generally speaking, SMT-LIB scripts specify satisfiability
problems for many-sorted first-order logic (MFOL) and
provide instructions for solvers to interact with these
specifications.
